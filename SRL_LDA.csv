wang_impact_2015;Impact of urban landscape and environmental externalities on spatial differentiation of housing prices in {Yangzhou} {City};Wang, Yang and Zhao, Lingling and Sobkowiak, Leszek and Guan, Xingliang and Wang, Shaojian;J. Geogr. Sci.;2015;;1122--1136;25; In this study, housing prices data for residential quarters from the period 2001–2012 were  used  and  Global  Differentiation  Index  (GDI)  was  established  to  measure  the  overall  differentiation trend in housing prices in Yangzhou City, eastern China. Then the influence of the  natural  landscape  and  environment  on  prices  of  global  housing  market  and  housing  submarkets was evaluated by the hedonic price model. The results are shown as follows. (1) There  have  been  increasing  gaps  among  housing  prices  since  2001.  In  this  period,  the  dif-ferentiation trend has shown an upward fluctuation, which has been coupled with the annual growth rate of housing prices. (2) The spatial distribution of residential quarters of homoge-nous prices has changed from clustered in 2001 into dispersed in 2012. (3) Natural landscape and environmental externalities clearly influence spatial differentiation of housing prices. (4) In  different  housing  submarkets,  the  influence  of  natural  landscape  and  environmental  ex-ternalities  are  varied.  Natural  landscape  characteristics  have  significant  impact  on  housing  prices of ordinary commercial houses and indemnificatory houses, while the impact of envi-ronmental characteristics have obvious influence on housing prices of cottages and villas.;"housing  prices;  spatial  differentiation;  GDI  index;  hedonic  price  method;  natural  landscape;  envi-ronment; Yangzhou ";SI;10.1007/s11442-015-1223-6;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11442-015-1223-6;;;;;1009-637X, 1861-9568;en;;;44376,19269;44376,19269;Emaxlibre7;;Accepted;

A butch of globalization the-ories devotes attention to the nature of global flows and their internal relationships. Global cities areoften viewed as nodes that passively convey and transmit flows. This article focuses on the role of ‘half-way’ nodes that circulate city images, and examines the activities of Hong Kong’s real estate developers inchanging Shanghai’s urban images from the 1990s onwards. It reveals the transformative role of thesedevelopers in the symbolic sphere of urban image making: from being subordinate to the urban designrequirements of the authority to their breaking away from the prescribed official framework and gainingthe edge in the state-developer interplay. This article contributes to globalization theories by arguing that‘halfway’ nodes are more likely to actively create, rather than passively pass on, ‘symbolic flows’ in Chinathrough the use of distinctive design languages.

giveki_new_2018;A New Neural Network Classifier Based on Atanassov’s Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set Theory;Giveki, Davar and Rastegar, Homayoun and Karami, Maryam;Opt. Mem. Neural Networks;2018;;170--182;27;This  paper  proposes  a  new  framework  for  training  radial  basis  function  neural  networks(RBFNN). Determination of the centers of the Gaussian functions in the hidden layer of RBF neuralnetwork highly affects the performance of the network. This paper presents a novel radial basis func-tion using fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm based on Atanassov’s intuitionistic fuzzy set (A-IFS)theory. The A-IFS theory takes into account another uncertainty parameter which is the hesitationdegree that arises while defining the membership function and therefore, the cluster centers convergeto  more  desirable  locations  than  the  cluster  centers  obtained  using  traditional  fuzzy  C-means  algo-rithm. Furthermore, we make use of a new objective function obtained by Atanassov’s intuitionisticfuzzy entropy. This objective function is incorporated in the traditional fuzzy C-means clustering algo-rithm to maximize the good points in the class. The proposed method is used to improve the function-ality of the Optimum Steepest Descent (OSD) learning algorithm. Adjusting RBF units in the networkwith great accuracy will result in better performance in fewer train iterations, which is essential whenfast retraining of the network is needed, especially in the real-time systems. We compare the proposedAtanassov’s  intuitionistic  radial  basis  function  neural  network  (A-IRBFNN)  with  fuzzy  C-meanradial  basis  function  neural  network  (FCMRBFNN)  while  both  methods  use  OSD  learning  algo-rithm.

This study tries to outline a comparative social-urban profile of Picanello, a popular central neighborhood of Catania, in Sicily, Italy, characterized by the combination of different urban and social life-quality levels, thus expressing a heterogeneous vulnerability/resilience profile. The analysis is placed in the urban planning context and aims to: (1) Denotative a pattern that considers the different fragility/resilience descriptive indices; and (2) connotative a pattern of the human and urban dimensions of the social capital asset. This analysis was performed by implementing a multidimensional pattern allowing us to place the neighborhood in a ranking of the neighborhoods of Catania, thus highlighting strength and weakness under different respects.

Accordingly, numerous studies have investigated the precise estimation and prediction of the HSI. However,previous studies have shown limitations in collecting valuable data that can be used for such estimations and predictions. Severalstudies have shown that web search data have a significant relationship with various social trends, including the HSI. The goal of thisstudy is to analyze the relationship between the HSI and feasible web search data and suggest an HSI prediction model based on theresults. Our analysis includes a method for enhancing the prediction accuracy using principal component analysis. The varimaxrotation method is used to find significant factors, and a genetic algorithm is used for optimization.

helbich_suburban_2015;Do suburban areas impact house prices?;Helbich, Marco;Environ Plann B Plann Des;2015;;431--449;42;Urban fringes are frequently occupied by a particular socioeconomic group of households, who have a certain demand on real-estate markets. Consequently, it is advisable to model the suburban housing market in hedonic studies. The operationalization of suburbia is challenged by its inherent vagueness, specifically, its continuous merging with rural areas and its potentially fragmented spatial pattern. Investigating the urban fringe of Vienna, Austria, this research proposes a suburban taxonomy based on fuzzy clustering and a spatially explicit, nonlinear hedonic pricing model to determine the marginal price of suburbia on single-family homes. The clustering result suggests that suburban municipalities are increasingly located next to the main traffic arterials in the immediate proximity of the core city. The hedonic regression confirms a stratification of the housing market. Furthermore, a local intra-submarket in the south of the core city is evident, referring to an additional locational asset. Suburbia has a significant effect on housing prices and reflects a self-contained housing market, albeit one which is economically interrelated with other submarkets. It is concluded that suburbanites implicitly value such neighborhoods and are willing to pay a premium to live in like-minded communities.;suburbanization, housing, submarkets, fuzzy clustering, generalized additive models, Vienna (Austria);SI;10.1068/b120023p;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/b120023p;;;;;0265-8135, 1472-3417;en;;;44376,19269;44376,19269;Emaxlibre7;;Accepted;

As sharing is a predominately urban phenomenon in modern societies, cities around the globe have become both locus of action and central actor in the debates over the nature and organization of the sharing economy. However, cities vary substantially in the interpretation of potential opportunities and challenges, as well as in their governance responses. Building on a qualitative comparative analysis of 16 leading global cities, our findings reveal four framings of the sharing economy: ‘societal endangerment,’ ‘societal enhancement,’ ‘market disruption,’ and ‘ecological transition.’ Such framings go hand in hand with patterned governance responses: although there is considerable heterogeneity in the combination of public governance strategies, we find specific configurations of framings and public governance strategies. Our work reflects the political and ethical debates on various economic, social, and moral issues related to the sharing economy, and contrib-utes to a better understanding of the field-level institutional arrangements—a prerequisite for examining moral behavior of sharing economy organizations;Sharing economy · Public governance · Urban governance · Global cities · Governance strategies · Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (f-s QCA;SI;10.1007/s10551-019-04242-4;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-019-04242-4;;;;;0167-4544, 1573-0697;en;;;44376,19269;44376,19269;Emaxlibre7;;Accepted;

Typically, this housing arrangement consists ofat least two young adult individuals without children.Sharing the flat and the housing costs is the basis oftheir relationship but living with others is an additionalmotive.  As  a  rule,  flat  sharing  bridges  two  distinctevents in the course of one’s life: the leaving of theparental home and the foundation of the first indepen-dent household.

However, the amenity effects of urban facilities havenot been fully assessed, and their spatial heterogeneity has largely been neglected. Taking Nanjing as an ex-ample, this study adopts a synthetic approach that considers scarcity, accessibility, and submarkets, and high-lights the influence of the idiosyncratic characteristics of urban facilities and heterogeneous urban spaces onhousing prices. We divide urban facilities into two categories based on scarcity: irreplaceable and replaceablefacilities.

cockx_determining_2020;Determining heterogeneity of residential location preferences of households in Belgium;Cockx, Kasper and Canters, Frank;Applied Geography;2020;;102271;124;Residential location choice behaviour is  a  key component of  the complex and dynamic human-environment interactions driving changes in  the urban landscape. The residential location choices that households make depend on their socio-economic characteristics, attitudes and life cycle stage as well as the location’s properties. The objective of this research was to analyse residential location preferences for different types of households in Belgium by developing a residential location choice model based on the use of regression trees. For each pref-erence group, a discrete choice model was estimated identifying the main factors influencing residential location choices, and how these differ depending on household characteristics. The data-driven approach proposed in this paper enables a transparent interpretation of the main household characteristics explaining differences in resi-dential location choice behaviour, and of  the varying effect of  location characteristics on residential location choice. Results obtained with the model show that tenure status, education level, nationality and household type successfully discriminate heterogeneous residential location preference profiles in Belgium. Model variables for each preference group demonstrate that not only socio-economic characteristics of the resident population, but also housing price and job accessibility differentially affect a  location’s  attractivity for different household profiles. ;Residential location choice Preference heterogeneity Households Discrete choice modeling Segmentation;SI;10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102271;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0143622819301298;;;;;01436228;en;;;44376,19269;44376,19269;Emaxlibre7;;Accepted;

With spatial error technique, the clusters ofThiessen polygons do not always provide the best outcome, and their superiority is contested by thehighest geographical level of municipalities.Research limitations/implications– This  paper  is  the  first  attempt  to  apply  the  proposedmethod,   which   not   always   demonstrates   clear   superiority.   In   future   study,   the   method   ofneighbourhood delineation could be used in combination with market segmentation.Practical implications– The  proposal  to  use  Thiessen  polygons  as  a  transition  from  points  tocontinuous space can outline a base for the use of different clustering techniques, which are applicableto delineate neighbourhoods in housing market studies, in particular for the assessment purpose. Thefuzzy equality clustering algorithm itself can be applied to polygonal data.Originality/value– The  originality  of  the  proposed  method  is  that  it  defines  neighbourhoodsstarting  from  individual  observations  applying  fuzzy  equality.  Its  advantages  are  an  increasedindependence from existing boundaries, self-determination of a number of clusters, and total coverageof an area.;Neighbourhood, Thiessen polygon, Clustering, Hedonic model, Out-of-sample prediction,Housing, Pricing;SI;10.1108/17538271311306039;https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/17538271311306039/full/html;;;;;1753-8270;en;;;44376,19269;44376,19269;Emaxlibre7;;Accepted;

hwang_delineating_2009;Delineating urban housing submarkets with fuzzy clustering;Hwang, Sungsoon and Thill, Jean-Claude;Environ. Plann. B;2009;;865--882;36;It has long been argued that the housing market is spatially compartmentalized within ametropolitan area. The argument has important implications for explaining how the housing marketworksˆshould the status quo be seen as an equilibrium state? Or if no equilibrium is reached, howdo loosely interlaced submarkets function both independently and interdependently? We note thatthe body of literature has leaned toward testing the distinctiveness of housing submarkets givena priori housing submarkets. However, there seems to be a lack of interest in developing methodsfor deriving housing submarkets empirically. Fuzzy clustering is well suited to this problem, giventhat the boundary of housing submarkets is not often sharply delineated. The study applies a fuzzyc-means (FCM) algorithm to identify housing submarkets in the Buffalo ^ Niagara Falls region. Thestudy is distinct from other FCM applications in three respects. First, we reflect on issues tied tochoosing parameters of fuzzy clustering. Second, we introduce overlap measures to characterize therelationship between the clusters produced. Third, we evaluate the performance of fuzzy clustering interms of hedonic prediction accuracy. Results show that stratified hedonic models predict house pricebetter than a market-wide hedonic model.

almeida_urban_2016;Urban population looking for rural landscapes: Different appreciation patterns identified in Southern Europe;Almeida, Mara and Loupa-Ramos, Isabel and Menezes, Helena and Carvalho-Ribeiro, Sónia and Guiomar, Nuno and Pinto-Correia, Teresa;Land Use Policy;2016;;44--55;53;In the context of the peripheral European rural landscapes, the role of the urban population, generally referred to as the ‘outsiders’, has shown to be influential in the dynamics of rural space. This influence occurs namely through the demand for non-productive functions leading to the emergence of new modes of occupancy. In addition, the emerging policy framework concerning policies and planning in rural landscapes call for an improved understanding of the diversified social demands for these landscapes. We argue that a more profound knowledge on the urban demand for rural landscape is needed to better integrate the urban interests into rural policy and planning. The present paper aims to gain greater insight on this demand by identifying landscape preferences of urban users, framed by the multifunctional transition theory, and using a photo-based survey with contrasting land covers derived from CORINE Land Cover classes. Furthermore, the use of land cover classes as the main landscape component, and thereby relating preferences to specific land covers, offers a sound basis for a territorial approach, able to integrate landscape into rural policy and land use planning practice. A case-study in Southern Portugal was developed at the regional scale and results showed different appreciation patterns for rural landscapes varying from humanised and more naturalised landscapes according to the different functions sought by urban users. Another prominent result is that urban demand for rural landscapes, even if driven by consumption, is strongly influenced by both protection and production values. A deeper knowledge on the interests of urban population can be a step forward for rural communities, land managers, and sectoral policy decision-makers to better define investment strategies in rural-urban partnerships facing the growing urban demand over rural space.;Rural landscape Urban population Landscape preferences Land cover Regional policy Alentejo region;SI;10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.09.025;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264837715002963;;;;;02648377;en;;;44376,19269;44376,19269;Emaxlibre7;;Accepted;
linz_inhabiting_2017;Inhabiting the impasse: Social exclusion through visible assemblage in neighborhood gentrification;Linz, Jess D.;Geoforum;2017;;131--139;85;"Now that gentrification has taken hold in central Cincinnati and begun to spill outward, nearby neighborhoodsin the early stages of gentrification have begun to call for“inclusive redevelopment”to bring vibrancy to de-pressed neighborhoods without displacing long-term residents. Neighborhood leaders and city officials under-stand that displacement happens along racial and class lines, yet efforts to directly address this issue have notchanged displacement patterns. Research shows social exclusion contributes to displacement in gentrifyingneighborhoods, and tends to focus on uneven impact across social categories like race and class, but there ismuch less attention to how exclusion is enacted and these categories reproduced. I argue that this takes placesimultaneously in the intimate space and time of everyday encounters, where proximity and relation unfoldaffectively through things and people to code them anew, pulling some into the momentum of redevelopment,while pushing others aside. This cognitive reversal of how categories work is important because it relocates theirorigin in small, interstitial, and nonhuman sites. Pairing assemblage theory and posthumanism with interviewsandfield notes, I demonstrate the role of nonhuman forces in shaping these encounters; how materials likecheese, pint glasses, trash, beards, and liver & onions play marked roles in producing marginalization. Myfindings show that things and people compose visible assemblages together, like a group of people sitting at asidewalk table eating pizza and drinking beer. These assemblages are operative in producing and reinforcingsocial exclusion: they usher practiced bias through the surface aesthetics of the assorted components, enablingaffective atmospheres to prescribe outcomes.

The statistic data are sourced from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC) and the data of land use change from the Ministry of Land and Resources of China (MLRC). The population of rural settlement decreases from the southeast to the northwest of China and the  density  of  rural  settlement  decreases  from  the  east  to  the  west  of  China.  Land-use  scale  of  rural  settlement,  the  proportion  of  one-storey houses and the average household area decrease from the north to the south of China. The ratio of area of cultivated land to rural settlement is high in the northeast and southwest of China but low in the southeast of China. The land use regionalization of rural settlement can be divided into four regions, namely: the northern region of China, Qinghai-Tibet, Yunnan-Guizhou, and the middle and eastern  region  of  China.  The  northern  region  of  China  and  the  middle  and  eastern  region  of  China  can  be  further  divided  into  nine sub-regions: Xinjiang, Northeast China, Ningxia and Inner Mongolia, North China, the south of the Changjiang (Yantze) River and Si-chuan Basin, Jiangsu-Shanghai, South China, the Loess Plateau, and Guangxi. In consideration of the significant regional differences, it is proposed thatdifferent policies should be implemented regarding the utilization and management of rural settlements.

The main purpose of this study is to detect homogeneous housing market areas among 196 districts of 5 major cities of Turkey in terms of house sale price indices. The second purpose is to forecast these 196 house sale price indices.


Design/methodology/approach
In this paper, the authors use the monthly house sale price indices of 196 districts of 5 major cities of Turkey. The authors propose an autoregressive (AR) model-based fuzzy clustering approach to detect homogeneous housing market areas and to forecast house price indices.


Findings
The AR model-based fuzzy clustering approach detects three numbers of homogenous property market areas among 196 districts of 5 major cities of Turkey where house sale price moves together (or with similar house sales dynamic). This approach also provides better forecasting results compared to standard AR models by higher data efficiency and lower model validation and maintenance effort.


Research limitations/implications
In this study, the authors could not use any district-based socioeconomic and consumption behavioral indicators and any discrete geographical and property characteristics because of the data limitation.


Practical implications
The finding of this study would help property investors for establishing more effective property management strategies by taking different geographical location conditions into account.


Social implications
From the government side, knowing future rises, falls and turning points of property prices in different locations can allow the government to monitor the property price changes and control the speculation activities that cause a dramatic change in the market.

The release of these classifications istherefore an appropriate moment to review the current ‘state of the art’in this particular form of consumer segmentation.This review starts with a brief account of how the marketingapplications to which these segmentation tools have been put haveevolved since their introduction in 1979, and an assessment of theirrelevance and scope in relation to other sources of data that marketerscan use to segment prospects and customers. The following section ofthe paper challenges the assumption that the finer the geographicgranularity of the units being classified the better the predictive powerof the classification, and questions the popular view thatgeodemographics is useful primarily in contexts where demographicdata at the household level are unavailable. This paper presentsevidence to suggest that neighbourhood often contributes incrementalpredictive power in behavioural models over and beyond individual-level characteristics. It is suggested, however, that there is no optimalscale for classifying neighbourhoods. Consumer behaviour withinsome product categories is better predicted using demographic datafor areas more geographically extensive than Census output areas,while for others the appropriate granularity is as low as unitpostcodes. The paper then advances a basis for judging which level ofgranularity, fine or small, is likely to be most valuable for predictingusage levels in different product categories.The concluding sections explain how changes in the marketingapplications to which geodemographic classifications are now put areaffecting the manner in which these systems are now constructed,resulting for instance in the use of data from sources additional to theCensus and in the use of new statistical methods for optimising theirpredictive performance.;geodemographics, segmentation, 2001 Census, cluster analysis, Mosaic, neighbourhoods;SI;10.1057/palgrave.im.4340240;http://link.springer.com/10.1057/palgrave.im.4340240;;;;;1463-5178, 1478-0844;;;;44376,19269;44376,19269;Emaxlibre7;;Accepted;

The analysis often is in a crisp partition form. But in practice, the sample are usually not well distributed, therefore the form may not be precisely defined. That is, one sample can belong to two or more groups. But, due to the fact that the requirements on the consumers and on the market are very high and the many real-market problems are fuzzy by nature and not random, the probability applications have not been very satisfactory in a lot of case. In this study, we adopt the fuzzy cluster method and attempt to combine a new compactness and separation validity function to build market segmentation in order to address the fuzziness among the group boundaries. Then we can use membership grade to describe each group. Therefore, the real market situation is clearly presented. Through membership grade, we depict the reality of the market, which lies between integers and real number. Buyers' mindsets are both rational and complicated, so their purchasing decisions are not predictable and are affected by many factors. The structural stability of the market can be tested by the loyalty of buyers who pertain to different clusters.

Additionally, the effects contain variable pure and spatial spillover impacts, alsoconditional on type and location, the separation of which highlights aspects not commonly accounted for.

Comparison of resultsfrom the two techniques indicated that the ANFIS-GP models performed better than the ANFIS-SC models. Thestudy suggests that the ANFIS-GP technique can be successfully used in the estimation of house prices in the con-struction sector.;House price Prediction model Real estate market Adaptive neuro-fuzzy;SI;10.1016/j.autcon.2014.02.002;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0926580514000211;;;;;09265805;en;;;44376,19269;44376,19269;Emaxlibre7;;Accepted;

These reflect the trends ofthe US housing market. In addition to these housing price indices, the development of a housing priceprediction model can greatly assist in the prediction of future housing prices and the establishment ofreal estate policies. This study uses machine learning algorithms as a research methodology to developa housing price prediction model. To improve the accuracy of housing price prediction, this paper ana-lyzes the housing data of 5359 townhouses in Fairfax County, Virginia, gathered by the Multiple ListingService (MLS) of the Metropolitan Regional Information Systems (MRIS). We develop a housing price pre-diction model based on machine learning algorithms such as C4.5, RIPPER, Naïve Bayesian, and AdaBoostand compare their classification accuracy performance. We then propose an improved housing price pre-diction model to assist a house seller or a real estate agent make better informed decisions based onhouse price valuation.

law_defining_2017;Defining Street-based Local Area and measuring its effect on house priceusing a hedonic price approach: The case study of Metropolitan London;Law, Stephen;Cities;2017;;166--179;60;An under-explored topic within thefield of planning and housing studies is related to the definition of local areaunit. An empirical problem that arises is that different types of local area units can infer different results. Thiscould be in constructing segregation indices, in estimating hedonic price models or in identifying housing submar-kets. This research proposes the concept of Street-based Local Area (SLA), in asking to what extent SLA associatewith house price. In order to examine this question, this article borrows from network science and space syntax re-search in defining SLA. This research conjectures that SLA has a significant effect on house price and that this effectis captured more strongly than ad-hoc administrative region-based local area. In order to test this conjecture, thisresearch adopted the multi-level hedonic price approach to estimate local area effects on house prices for the casestudy of Metropolitan London in the United Kingdom. Results showed significant local area effects on house pricesand that SLA is preferred to region-based one. The plausible reasons arefirstly, people perceived the local area on astreet network. Street-based Local Area is able to capture more precisely subtle perceptual differences in an urbanenvironment than an ad-hoc administrative region. Second, the topology of thestreet network reinforces the socio-economic similarity/differences overtime. Differences between local areas can become more pronounced as like-minded people bump into each other, cluster together and share information with each other. Third, as peopleidentify these local areas they would make decisions based on it. The local area becomes part of the housing bundleleading to it having an effect on house price. The main contribution of the research is the novel application of com-munity detection techniques on the street-network dual graph to defining SLA. This is important as it links the to-pology of the street network to how we define and perceive local area and it presents an alternative to ad-hocadministrative geographies that are currently applied in many aspects of neighbourhood planning.;Community detectionMulti-level regression modelHedonic price approachNeighbourhood planningSpace syntaxDual graph;SI;10.1016/j.cities.2016.08.008;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264275116304383;;;;;02642751;en;;;44376,19269;44376,19269;Emaxlibre7;;Accepted;

In property val-uation and housing market research, the locational value is usually analyzed by hedonic methods that use multiple regression techniqueson large data sets and require a formality based on microeconomic theory in the analyses. Because of potential non-linearity in the hedo-nic functions, artificial neural network (ANN) is employed in this study as an alternative method.

hu_monitoring_2019;Monitoring housing rental prices based on social media: An integrated approach of machine-learning algorithms and hedonic modeling to inform equitable housing policies;Hu, Lirong and He, Shenjing and Han, Zixuan and Xiao, He and Su, Shiliang and Weng, Min and Cai, Zhongliang;Land Use Policy;2019;;657--673;82;National land use policies and strategies worldwide have attempted to establish a healthy housing rental market towards urban sustainability. Monitoring fine-scale housing rental prices should provide essential implications for equitable housing policies. However, doing so remains a challenge because aggregated data were traditionally collected at a coarse scale through census or social surveys. On-line housing rental websites (OHRWs) have become popular social media platforms in the housing studies. This paper attempts to demonstrate how to monitor fine-scale housing rental prices based on OHRWs using the case of Shenzhen in China. Employing hedonic model, a set of housing rental determinants are initially selected from three characteristics (neighborhood, location and structure) and at three levels (nearest accessibility, 15-minute walking distance availability and sub-district availability). Housing rent prediction models are then established (respectively for October 2017 and February 2018) using the training samples collected from the OHRWs and six machine-learning algorithms, including random forest regression (RFR), extra-trees regression (ETR), gradient-boosting regression (GBR), support vector regression (SVR), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) and k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN). Thereafter, the relative importance of the determinants is calculated and visualized using partial dependence plots. Finally, the models are used to monitor housing rental price dynamics for all of the communities within Shenzhen. Results show that all of the algorithms except SVR generally present good performance. Among them, RFR and ETR are the best one in October 2017 and February 2018, respectively. Concerning the spatial pattern of housing rental, the high-high clusters merge in the central districts, whereas the low-low clusters are located in the outskirts, and the growth rate is the greatest in the farthest outskirts from the central districts. Each determinant affects the housing rent across different scale and sub-district availability and nearest accessibility are more important than 15-minute walking distance availability. The two most influential determinants are sub-district job opportunity and nearest accessibility to health care facilities. The case of Shenzhen shows that the demonstrated framework, which integrates machine-learning algorithms and the hedonic modeling, is practical and efficient. The approach is believed to provide an essential tool to inform equitable housing policies.;Housing rental price Social media Hedonic model Multilevel determinants Machine learning Equitable housing policies;SI;10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.12.030;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264837718316429;;;;;02648377;en;;;44376,19269;44376,19269;Emaxlibre7;;Accepted;

We have focused on as missing flexibility in cluster number adaptation; limited cluster type grouping; less than optimal objective function for clusters of unequal size lying very close to each other; considerable computational time particularly in case of high dimensional  data.  With  M&MFCM  we  propose  to  replace  the  usual  Euclidean  distance  with  Mahalanobis  and  Minkowski  metrics  in  order  to  enhance  the  cluster  detection  capacity  of  FCM  by  allowing  more  accurate  detection  of  arbitrary  shapes  of  clusters  for  high  dimensional  datasets.  Direct  replacement  of  Euclidean  distance  in  the  objective  function  of  FCM  with  Mahalanobis might cause numerical problems as the largest eigenvalues of the fuzzy covariance matrix could produce extremely long clusters thus contradicting the real data distribution. The improvement is achieved by fixing the ratio between the maximal and minimal eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. The parameterized Minkowski distance metric is adapted for implementation with  FCM  with  various  settings.

In an attempt towards such an understanding, this study analyses the eco-social transformation of the East Kolkata Wetland (EKW). As a primary step to examine the patterns and drivers of wetland change in the EKW, land cover changes have been quantified. In addition, the significance of the driving factors has been adjudged and modelled using Wetland Shrinkage Monitoring (WSM) model. The outcome shows that wetland shrinkage largely determined by proximity forces of urban growth.

used method for identifying housing submarkets is based on cluster analysis,
although hedonic analysis has been extensively used. The hedonic analysis is used
to derive dimensionality of the housing market by estimating what attributes are
significant factors influencing housing price. Those attributes or variables can then
be used for cluster analysis. The paper proposes an analysis of the real estate market

approaches to defining its possible submarkets articulation. The first one is a hard
clustering approach using the K-means method and hypothesizing different numbers of clusters. The second one can be considered a verification of the previous
results: a fuzzy algorithm is applied to obtain the fuzzy set membership degree of
each data point to housing submarkets defined within the examined urban area. The

Multicollinearity among correlated factors may cause
negative effects when building CA transition rules, leading
to a decrease in simulation accuracy. We use a nonparametric generalized additive model (GAM) to evaluate these
relationships through flexible smooth functions to capture
the dynamics of urban growth. A GAM-based CA (termed
GAM-CA) model was then developed to simulate the rapid
urban growth in Shanghai, China from 2000 to 2015. GAM
highlights the significance of each candidate factor driving
urban growth during the past 15 years. Compared to
logistic regression, the GAM-CA transition rules fitted the
observed data better and yielded improved overall accuracy
and hence more realistic urban growth patterns. The new
CA model has great potential for capturing key driving
factors to simulate dynamic urban growth, and can predict

The web tool is integrated with the usual catalogue of resources for rental or for sale, enriched with the possibility of ranking a subset of properties according to the client’s preferences and the internal knowledge associated to the properties. Usually the description of a property is quantitative, thought in our case we add qualitative information corresponding to assessments made by housing agents. These agents are considered experts in the market conditions. We apply the 2-tuple linguistic representation model to keep accuracy in the processes of Computing with Words and the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets to qualify in situations of uncertainty and hesitation in the assessments. The software helps the agents in the process of the elicitation of the linguistic expression based on the fuzzy linguistic approach and the use of context-free grammars, and the web clients in the decision of visiting a property;Hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set Linguistic 2-tuples Multicriteria decision making Web services Housing market;SI;10.1016/j.asoc.2015.01.030;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1568494615000496;;;;;15684946;en;;;44376,19269;44376,19269;Emaxlibre7;;Accepted;
